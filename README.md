# ContactAPI - Tech Challenge


Postman tests can be found under *ContactAPI/Properties/Postman/ContactAPITests.postman_collection.json*

Written in Visual Studio with LiteDB https://www.litedb.org/


### *Notes*

Two unit tests are failing when tests are run all at once, but pass when run individually. Unsure why this is happening, but I'm guessing there is some shared test dependency I am missing.

Swagger Runs on https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html when running the API directly.
